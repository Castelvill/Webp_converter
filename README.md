# webp_converter
Python scipt converts .webp files into image files with choosen extension.

To generate executables I used pyinstaller. Some of executables ends with "killer" word, these REMOVE .webp files after the conversion. You can't recover them.

If you want to use the script without deleting files, remove the line with "os.remove".
